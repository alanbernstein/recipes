	<h3>Ingredients </h3>
	<ul>
	
<li>1 stick butter, melted</li>
<li>2 cups sugar</li>
<li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
<li>4 eggs, beaten</li>
<li>2 tablespoons all purpose flour</li>
<li>1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
<li>1 unbaked 9″ (deep dish) pie shell or 2 unbaked 9″ (shallow) pie shells*</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Directions</h2>
	<ol>
	
<li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
<li>Place the butter and sugar in the mixing bowl of a stand mixer, or use a hand mixer.</li> 
<li>Mix together on medium speed for a couple of minutes.</li>
<li>Add the whipping cream and mix on high speed for about two minutes until the cream has started to slightly thicken and the mixture is light and fluffy.</li>
<li>Add the beaten eggs, vanilla and flour and mix well.</li>
<li>Pour the batter into unbaked pie shell'(s) and cover the edges of the crust with foil.
<li>Bake for abou</li>t 45 minutes until the top is golden brown and no longer jiggly in the center.
<li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Notes</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>*The original recipes states to use a 9″ pie shell. If you use a store bought pie shell, the filling is almost too much for one deep dish pie shell…the top gets too brown before the filling gets done. I prefer to bake this pie filling in 2 “shallow” pie shells. It’s a thinner pie, but turns out perfect.</li>
		
	</ul>
