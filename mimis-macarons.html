			<li id="mv_create_11_1">Complete all the PREP WORK as listed in post. </li>
			<li id="mv_create_11_2">In a big bowl, sift together the almond flour and powdered sugar. </li><li id="mv_create_11_3">In a separate bowl, whip room temperature egg whites on low speed with a handheld mixer until foamy, add cream of tartar. (Further reading: <a href="https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/how-to-make-perfect-meringue-for-macarons/">How to make perfect meringue for macarons</a>.)</li><li id="mv_create_11_4">Once the beater starts leaving tracks in the egg whites and the bubbles have tightened up in size, add granulated sugar ⅓ at a time. Increase to med speed.</li><li id="mv_create_11_5">Once all the sugar has been fully incorporated and before reaching stiff peaks, add 1-3 drops of gel color to your liking. Whip on med-high until Stiff Peaks.</li><li id="mv_create_11_6">Test meringue stiffness. It should have pointed peaks when the whisk is pulled out. </li><li id="mv_create_11_7">Pour a third of the almond/powdered sugar mixture into the egg whites. Gently fold it into the egg whites. Then add the rest of the mixture and fold. </li><li id="mv_create_11_8">Stop folding once the dry ingredients have been fully incorporated and the batter has reached a “lava” like or honey consistency. The batter should pass the figure-8 test. (Watch video: <a href="https://youtu.be/iv9reKJ-uTI">How to Macaronage for No Hollows</a>)</li><li id="mv_create_11_9">On parchment paper or silicone mats, pipe the batter to the size of the circle on the template.

(Further reading: <a href="https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/proper-macaron-batter-consistency-after-piping/">Proper macaron batter consistency while piping</a>.)</li><li id="mv_create_11_10">Remove the paper template from underneath the parchment paper or mat. </li><li id="mv_create_11_11">Rap the tray several times on the counter to rid of excess bubbles. </li><li id="mv_create_11_12">Before the batter dries, pop any remaining bubbles with a toothpick. </li><li id="mv_create_11_13">Let it rest on the counter for 30 min. AND until a “skin” has developed. This will prevent the shells from cracking during baking. (Further reading: <a href="https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/macaron-shells-wont-dry/">Resting the macaron shell</a>.)</li><li id="mv_create_11_14">Preheat oven to 320 F.

Bake only one tray at a time.</li><li id="mv_create_11_16">Take them out and test doneness. The feet should not push back and the shell should not be wobbly. </li><li id="mv_create_11_17">Let them cool off on the pan (or off if they are overdone). </li><li id="mv_create_11_18">Fill macarons with an <a href="https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/basic-chocolate-ganache-filling-for-macarons/" target="_blank">easy 3 ingredient chocolate filling</a> or your own favorite filling. (Further reading: <a href="https://www.indulgewithmimi.com/macaron-filling-ideas/">Yummy Macaron Filling Ideas</a>)</li><li id="mv_create_11_19">Leave them in the fridge in an airtight container and let them mature for 24 hours.

They will remain fresh stored in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days, depending on filling used. ENJOY! </li></ol> </div>
