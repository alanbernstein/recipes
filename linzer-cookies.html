	<h2>Ingredients </h2>
	<h3>Cookies</h3>
	<ul>

<li>2 sticks unsalted butter, at rom temperature</li>
<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 large egg</li>
<li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
<li>3 cups all-purpose flour (fluffed before measuring)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
<li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>

	<h3>Jam</h3>
		<li>¾ cup of your favorite jam</li>
		<li>2 teaspoons booze</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Directions</h2>
	<ol>
		
<li>In a stand-mixer bowl, add the butter and sugar. Turn the mixer to medium speed, and beat until combined, about 30 seconds. Crank it to high, and beat for 30 seconds to make it pale yellow and fluffy.</li>
<li>Next, add the egg and vanilla and beat until combined.</li>
<li>Sprinkle the flour, baking powder and salt evenly over the mixture. Beat until combined--be sure to scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl to ensure its evenly mixed.</li>
<li>Gather one-quarter of the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and roll out until about ¼" thick. Use a 2" round biscuit cutter to cut out as many circles as possible, and then use a mini heart-shaped cutter to cut out hearts in half of the circles. Carefully move the shapes to a lined cookie sheet, and place in the freezer for 15 minutes.</li>
<li>Repeat with all remaining dough (or just use half and freeze the rest, like I did)
<li>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350.</li>
<li>Bake the cookies for 9 minutes, until just starting to turn golden brown.
<li>Let the cookies cool completely.</li>
<li>Stir together the jams and booze until slightly thinner.</li>
<li>Sprinkle powdered sugar on top of all of the cookies.</li>
<li>Place a ½-teaspoon dollop of jam on the circle cookies, and top with a cut-out heart cookie to sandwich together.</li>
<li>These cookies are good on day one, but even better on day two when they soften.</li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Notes</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>I used ¼ cup strawberry jam with 2 teaspoons orange liquor, ¼ cup peach jam with 2 teaspoons of Bourbon, and ¼ cup of blackberry jam with Chambord.</li>
		
	</ul>
