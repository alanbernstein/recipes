        <h2>Alan's Chili</h2>
        
        ingredients
        <ul>
        <li>2 pounds of ground beef or ground beef style fake meat</li>
        <li>2 onion, 1/4" chop</li>
        <li>3-5 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>1-2 bell peppers</li>
        <li>2 can of black beans</li>
        <li>1 can of pinto beans</li>
        <li>1 can of kidney beans</li>
        <li>1 can of corn, drained</li>
        <li>1 small can chipotles en adobo</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon chili powder (see note)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp cumin seeds (optional)</li>
        <li>1 cinnamon stick (optional)</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Fresh ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Cayenne powder to taste</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon neutral flavor cooking oil (like vegetable, peanut or canola, not olive oil or sesame oil)</li>
        <li>cheddar cheese and tortilla chips and maybe some cilantro if you're into that sort of thing</li>
        </ul>
        
        preparation
        <ol>
        <li>Heat oil on medium-high heat in a medium pot or deep saute pan</li>
        <li>When the oil is hot, throw in the *onion*.  Crush the *garlic* by placing the side of your knife on top of it and smashing with your hand, add to pan.  Cook until the onion begins to become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the *chili powder* and *cumin seed*, cook for 3 or so minutes, but be careful not to burn the spices.</li>
        <li>Add *green pepper*</li>
        <li>If using *ground beef*, add it and cook until browning, if using fake ground beef, add it and break it up, cook for just a few minutes until warmed through.</li>
        <li>Add the *adobo sauce and chipotles*, and *tomatoes* with reserved liquid, cook until starting to boil</li>
        <li>Add the *beans* with their liquid and the *corn*</li>
        <li>Add the whole *Cinnamon stick* and *bay leaf*</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium low and cook until desired consistency, stir regularly to prevent bottom from burning.  I'd also partially cover it to prevent liquid from shooting everywhere, but still allowing for reduction.</li>
        </ol>
